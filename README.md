# Welcome to the public Porsche Design System contribution board
Following an open community approach, everyone is encouraged to contribute PRs, give feedback or request changes to the Porsche Design System. To manage all kinds of issues, we created this public contribution board.

## Contribute or request changes
To suggest or submit changes first **[create a new issue here](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-ui-contribution/issues/new/choose)** so that the Porsche Design System team can review them. For directly contributing Pull Requests in the private Repository, the required permissions can be assigned to the relevant user case-dependent.

## How do I report bugs and how are they handled?
Once you find a reproducible bug you can either **[open a new bug issue here](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-ui-contribution/issues/new/choose)**  or directly submit a fix as Pull Request within the private Porsche Desibn System repository. We will address and respond to new bug reports as soon as possible, usually within some days.
