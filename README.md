# Welcome to the public Porsche Design System Contribution Repo
Following an open community approach we encourage everyone to participate actively in request features, comment or contribute to the Porsche Design System. To manage all kinds of issues centrally, we created this public contribution repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please **[first have a look on the already existing community issues](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system-contribution/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)** do avoid duplicates.

## Request changes and features
If you need enhancements or modifications you can **[open a new feature issue](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system-contribution/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request%2C+open&template=request.md&title=Request+%2F+)** clearly describing the need and context and also promote the priority for its completion. For directly contributing Pull Requests [please use our private Repo](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-design-system).

üëç We priorize new features based on its enterprise- and user-value and based on the community voting. You can upvote feature requests by opening the issue and adding the +1 reaction to issues (top right corner)

## Report bugs
