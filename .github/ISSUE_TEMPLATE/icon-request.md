Note: 
Icons are simple visuals to communicate functionality in user interfaces, reduced in complexity to work well on small sizes. 
For marketing or presentational context we use more complex pictograms instead.

Please verify that your request can not be fulfilled with an already existing icon of https://icons.porsche.com.

**Scope**  
Describe clearly the context and needs for the requested icon(s).
For which icon and on which touchpoint do you want to use the icon.

**Examples**
What metaphors could describe the functionality?

**Notes**  
- Link to related documents, i.e. Abstract Collection or Code Example
- Further information that is relevant for processing

**ISO/Unicode reference**
Is the icon part of the ISO or unicode standard?

**Timeline issues**
Do you need the icon within a specific time period? Is it related to a fixed release?
